# Restaurant cuisines analysis
Examine order data to determine the best- and worst-selling menu items and cuisine types

**The goal** of this research is to determine the most and least popular menu items and cuisine types by analyzing order data. The main objective was to assist the company in making data-driven decisions to improve marketing tactics, manage inventory effectively, and optimize the menu.

## Project Objectives
1. Find the most and least popular dishes and cuisines by analyzing ordering trends.
2. Support company decision-making by offering advice on which menu items should be changed, eliminated, or promoted.
3. Optimize resource allocation by making suggestions for effective resource distribution and inventory control.

## Needs for Businesses
Understanding consumer preferences is essential for the restaurant business in order to maximize profits and reduce expenses. The following important business questions are addressed by this analysis:
1. What are the most popular foods and cuisines?
2. Are consumer tastes affected by the season?
3. Which menu items can have low demand and not be profitable?
4. Are there chances for exclusive promotions or cross-selling?

## How I Found and Shared My Findings
Data collection and cleaning involved working with order data and looking for duplicates and missing values.

Order volume, average order value, and frequency of certain dishes and cuisine types were all studied in the key metric analysis.

Data visualization: produced tables, graphs, and charts that clearly show trends. **In Progress**

Conclusions and Suggestions: I developed business suggestions for menu and sales plan enhancements based on the results.


## Important Results
American (hamburgers, cheeseburgers, and French fries) and Asian (edamame, Korean beef bowl) cuisines were the most popular, indicating a significant customer preference for these dishes.
Mexican food was the least popular, suggesting that there may be room to change the menu or introduce

## Outcome
This effort helped identify the most profitable goods and development locations.
